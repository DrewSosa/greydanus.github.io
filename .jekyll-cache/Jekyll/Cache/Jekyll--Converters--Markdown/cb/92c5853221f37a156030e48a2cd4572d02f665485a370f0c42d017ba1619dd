<p>In our old house, hummingbirds used to fly into our garage and get stuck. I remember finding one perched on a windowsill, weak from exertion. It let me fold my hands around it and sat motionless while I carried it outside. And when I opened my hands, it lay upon my palms for a moment. That’s when the sunlight ignited its iridescent plumage and engulfed its whole body in a cloud of blues and greens. Then it understood it was free, whirred its wings, and vanished into the open air.</p>

<p>Long after it had departed, my mind’s eye gazed upon the little bird. With an idle curiosity, I wondered at the delicate balance of natural forces that had wrought such a thing. We know of lift and drag, thrust and gravity as rough textbook concepts. But it’s another thing entirely to gaze upon a creature of beauty and sophistication and realize that it was shaped largely by those simple forces.</p>

<p>I admire wings; I have always admired them. Looking at a wing, you get the sense that there is more than meets the eye. Beneath its surface simplicity lies a bedrock of sophisticated natural engineering. Every thermal, gust of turbulence, or acrobatic maneuver has been prepared for in advance by eons of evolutionary forces. Such command of the air will forever be beyond me with my apish physique. And yet what the human body lacks in aerodynamics, the human mind makes up for with its desire to fly.</p>

<p>When you think about it, it is very strange that we have a desire to fly. Our primate ancestors should have learned to fear the skies, for they are home to predatory eagles. Our fear of heights makes a lot more sense. After all, our bodies are not good at recovering from falls and we are certainly not adapted for flight. Yet for some reason we want to fly. Why would nature give us a desire that our bodies cannot satisfy?</p>

<p>Perhaps such a desire is the foundation of tool-making. Consider the hermit crab, who lives according to a similar paradox. His form is incomplete without his shell, yet he does not grow it. He is born with an urge to acquire one. And when he finds one, he cleans it and fits himself to it and his body grows or shrinks to make the fit perfect. The hermit crab and his home become one creature, even though the shell was once part of his environment. It is the same with humans and wings. After all, if we can think ourselves into flight, then in a sense we are as much a flying species as the birds, insects, and bats.</p>

<p>There are several ways to make these ideas more concrete and I will explore each of them in this essay. The first is to examine the human pioneers of flight: who they were, what they thought, and why they flew. For by studying how they thought, we can get a better idea of how the urge to fly relates to human nature. The second is to examine the trial and error engineering process that ultimately led to modern airplane wings. After all, being able to manifest our desire to fly in the physical world is at least as important as the desire itself. And finally, I will build you a wing. I will do this by writing down the physics of airflow, using that physics to simulate wind, and then directing that wind onto a rectangle of matter. Then I will coax the rectangle to deform itself so as to generate efficient lift…and you will see that it deforms itself into the cross-section of a wing.</p>

<p>That’s how I will make my case that we are a winged species. For indeed we are, so long as we have the desire to fly.</p>

<h2 id="the-early-aviators">The Early Aviators</h2>

<p>From the Greek story of Icarus to the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci, humans have always gazed into the depthless blue sky and wondered at its possibilities. One of the great gifts of the scientific revolution was the ability to finally manifest those dreams. The past century has taken us from the Wright brothers’ ramshackle Flyer to the razor-edged precision of the SR-71 Blackbird. And our commercial aviation system makes it possible for anyone to realize the possibilities of flight. Indeed, flight has become so common and so reasonable that it’s easy to forget the towering lusts and follies that brought us here. To remember those sensations, we need to look back at the humans for which the desire to fly was strongest: the early aviators. And of all the early aviators, perhaps nobody risked more in the pursuit of flight than the tower jumpers.</p>

<p>Beginning in Medieval times, there was a string of talented inventors who, after years of careful thought and study, strapped bird feathers to their arms, climbed to the top of the nearest tower, and leaped into thin air. As with modern daredevils on TV, things tended to end rather badly for these people. An exception to the rule was the Andalusian inventor Abbas ibn Firnas. It wasn’t until the ripe old age of seventy that he finally strapped eagle feathers to himself and leaped off a cliff. But as tower jumpers go, he was a major success: the feather suit cushioned his fall and helped him glide to the ground where he sustained a few minor injuries.</p>

<p>It’s easy to laugh at the tower jumpers for their foolish and unsophisticated approach to flight. However, it’s also worth admiring them for their willingness to risk everything. These people wanted to fly more than anything else. What motivated them? This isn’t a behavior that we see in, say, monkeys or dogs. Perhaps it has something to do with our capacity for abstraction. It would work this way: imagine a human who feels trapped by their circumstances. Without abstract thought, this person would simply wish for the details of their situation to change. But with abstract thought, they would develop a deep hunger for freedom in the abstract sense. Now, if they view the abstract idea of flight as something that confers freedom, it is entirely rational for them to put their effort into the pursuit of flight, especially if all other doors are closed. This is called “” in clinical psychology, and the story of Leonardo da Vinci is a great example.</p>

<p>Many people know that Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa and invented a series of remarkable flying machines. But few are aware of the pressures that shaped him. He was born the illegitimate son of an Italian aristocrat and so, in spite of his genius, lived a life without much political or financial power. While he was learning to paint and invent, he had to support himself by seeking out wealthy patrons. Also, he was gay. One of the turning points in his life occurred around his 27th birthday, when he was imprisoned for acts of sodomy. As soon as he was released, he sketched a machine meant to “open a prison from the inside” and another for tearing bars off of windows. He fell in love with the idea of flight as a form of freedom, and began buying birds at markets in order to free them from their cages. And of course, he began sketching flying machines like the da Vinci glider. “Once you have tasted flight” he wrote, “you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward. For there you have been, and there you will always long to return.”</p>

<p>But not all early aviators were after freedom. For others, the abstraction was glory, and none of them loved glory more than Pilatre de Rozier. This man was quite a character. He liked to breathe fire, seduce older women, and give himself fake titles. As a young scientist, he signed his papers, “Apothecary,” then “first Apothecary,” and finally, “Pharmacy Inspector” of the Prince of Limbourg. This earned him the respect of his colleagues…until they discovered that the Prince of Limbourg did not, in fact, exist. Ironically, it was this same hunger for glory that led de Rozier to his greatest discoveries. The first was the match. He invented it while showing off his mastery of fire to the public. The second was the gas mask, which he invented after lowering himself into the fumes of a vat of fermenting beer. And third, of course, was the manned voyage of a hot air balloon. King Louis XVI wanted to put criminals in the balloon but de Rozier objected, saying “The glory should not be given to criminals!”</p>

<p>In spite of all his posturing, de Rozier really did give aeronauts a reputation for bravery and adventure. And in preventing the king from using criminals in the balloon, he built on da Vinci’s vision of the skies as a place of freedom rather than exile. By most accounts, de Rozier was a mediocre scientist, but what he lacked in intelligence he made up for in energy and persistence. Indeed, these two qualities are at least as important as intelligence when it comes to flight. For even the brilliant mind of Einstein was once badly mistaken about such things.</p>

<p>Few people realize that Einstein invented an airplane wing. It had a strange hump in the center which proved to be a dreadful mistake. Test pilots complained that it handled “like a pregnant duck” and years later Einstein confessed, “That is what can happen to a man who thinks a lot but reads little…I have to admit that I have been ashamed of my folly of those days.” Einstein is a good example of someone who was clever enough to make progress in aeronautics, but who didn’t have a deep desire to fly. The more successful pioneers saw flight as part of their destiny. At some point, the person and the plane became indistinguishable. Pilots like Audrey de Saint-Exupéry claimed that the sky was the only place where one could think clearly.</p>

<p>Saint-Exupery was another fascinating character. He was a pilot, but also one of France’s best poets and novelists. He brought his writing notebook with him on solo flights and once circled a landing strip for an hour to finish reading a novel. He is best known for writing the story, “The Little Prince” in which two aeronauts contemplate life, love, and human nature. Flight is a key metaphor in the story, probably because Saint-Exupery understood life best from that perspective. But we must remember that humans did not evolve to fly. In fact, it’s shocking that Saint-Exupery could write insightful stories about humans through the lens of something as artificial as flight. Perhaps that paradox is what makes flight a good metaphor. It highlights our irrational urges for abstract things like freedom, glory, or wisdom. For the early aviators, the pursuit of flight was not profitable. More often, it led to bankruptcy, social isolation, and death or injury. Leading an ordinary life would have been the more rational choice.</p>

<p>Amelia Earhart was deeply aware of this tension. She once wrote, “…I cannot endure at all times even an attractive cage.” In other words, she preferred the dangers and uncertainties of flight to the comforts of civilized life. But her words mean even more in context, for she wrote them in her prenuptial letter to her fiance George Putnam. Putnam agreed to an open marriage with Earhart, and this let her push the limits of flight at a time when it was very difficult to become a woman pilot.</p>

<p>It’s easy to think of Earhart, da Vinci, and the others as exceptions to a rule. Perhaps the majority of humans would prefer to keep both feet planted firmly on the ground. Yet how many of us have felt a twinge of envy for a hawk soaring effortlessly on the thermals? Flight is more than a practicality for us. Is it because we associate flight with freedom? Or glory? Or are these desires a manifestation of some deeper desire? Whatever the case, the thing that inspired the early aviators continues to live within us. Our grand challenge is to act on this desire. It’s not easy to do this, but we can learn a lot by turning our attention to the inventors of early airplanes. These are the people who, through a combination of luck and discipline, built the stepping stones of flight.</p>

<h2 id="the-stepping-stones-of-flight">The Stepping Stones of Flight</h2>

<p>By the year 1900, humans seemed to have figured out all the important ideas of aviation. There were patents for dozens of self-powered aircraft including biplanes, seaplanes, and bombers. There were also designs for retractable landing gear, aileron wing controls, and curved airfoils. To many people, these designs indicated that the age of the airplane was at hand. Indeed, by this time there were already two commercial airline startups and one program for constructing bombers, fully funded by the French government. But there was just one problem: nobody had managed to fly a real airplane yet. In fact, the Wright brothers were still several years from achieving that breakthrough. As for bombers, seaplanes, and airline companies, such things were still many decades away.</p>

<p>This bizarre gap between theory and practice makes me think we need to be more conservative with the word “invention.” When we think of an invention, we usually think of a detailed design of the sort you could patent. But in the case of the airplane, we know that people patented dozens of airplanes that could never have flown. Were those patents really inventions? Otto Lilienthal, the first glider pilot, would have disagreed. “To design an aircraft is nothing” he wrote, “To build one is something. But to fly is everything.”</p>

<p>Perhaps we should think of invention as having two phases: design and demonstration. An invention isn’t complete until you’ve shown that it can perform the task for which it was built. In this section, we will step out of the human mind and into the constraints of the physical world. This is a rough place to be, for only a small fraction of human ideas manage to survive. But those that do can produce fantastic results. And just as the delicate wings of a hummingbird are wonderful because of the forces that shaped them, so are modern aircrafts particularly inspiring because of the extreme conditions they are built to endure.</p>

<p>Since flight is a very complicated subject, I am going to focus specifically on the development of the modern airfoil. There are no moving parts to an airfoil. In fact, the airfoil is just a two dimensional shape that influences the speed of air above and below a wing. Prior to the Wright brothers, few people gave serious thought to airfoil design. But it just so happened that the details of this shape were of critical importance to the practical manifestation of flight, and this has continued to be the case to the present day. Only through repeated iteration of design and demonstration did we become aware of the airfoil’s surprising complexity.</p>

<p>Lilienthal, with his emphasis on pragmatic results, made the first major contribution to airfoil design. He performed a detailed investigation of stork wings. Then, with their curvature in mind, he built artificial replicas in his laboratory and tested their lift coefficients. It took years of careful preparation to do all of this, but in the end he was able to make a successful glider flight. And when he finally flew, he was able to repeat the demonstration over and over again.</p>

<p>But even Lilienthal got some things wrong. The Wright brothers, in their efforts to build upon his work, discovered an error in his calculations. This specific detail was enough to make them rethink the entire wing design. After testing hundreds of airfoils in a miniature wind tunnel, they settled on a shape that was just slightly larger and more arched. This doesn’t sound like a very sexy way to spend two years of research, but it was a crucial milestone on the path to real flight. The Wright brothers were a rare breed of practical dreamers who set themselves an ambitious goal and then broke it down into manageable bits. Each little bit represented an unknown variable, and step by step they ventured into the unknown, made sense of it, and turned it into something of value.</p>

<p>In a way, the long hours of tedious labor are the sacrifice one must make when they pursue the romantic-sounding “desire to fly.” We’ve seen that flight attracts people who tend to be radical and temperamental dreamers. They are not reliable people. And yet each of them had to discipline and civilize themselves, becoming the most dull and reliable of the lot of us, before earning the right to become a hero. Once again, the human capacity for abstraction seems to be a crucial ingredient to this cycle. The boring years of experiments become so closely linked to the idea and reward of flight that they become one. The work becomes the reward. This is a strange abstraction and it’s amazing that our minds are capable of thinking this way. And one might think that even if an individual can think this way, a society probably cannot.</p>

<p>Yet this is exactly what happened next. The major airfoil designs of the 1910s and 20s came out of national labs set up by forward-thinking governments at the beginning of World War I. At the time, airplanes were slow, unreliable, and expensive. They were great for stunts and parades, but close to useless on the battlefield. The purpose of the new national labs was to change this.</p>

<p>The first innovations came out of Britain’s National Physical Laboratory. Researchers at this lab had far more manpower and resources than the early inventors, so they were able to test airfoil designs more thoroughly. They found that thicker wings with more forward camber gave better lift and promptly built this into their fighters.</p>

<p>The more relevant concern, however, was stability. The planes of World War I suffered from thin airfoil stall, which happens when the airstreams above and below the wing collide behind it. This creates drag, and sends the plane into a stall. German engineers discovered that a thicker airfoil could reduce this effect, leading to the Gottingen 398 design. They used this design on the Fokker D7 triplane and it ended up being one of the most dangerous fighters of the war.</p>

<p>The most amazing thing about flight research during World War I was the speed that inventors could turn a good idea into real technology. It only took a year or two. The condensed timeline and extreme real-world impact served as a conclusive demonstration of the airplane’s value and finalized its transition from the world of ideas to the world of things. And the wonderful thing about realizing the potential of an invention is its tendency to become the bedrock for an entirely new generation of ideas. That’s the story of the 1920’s and 30’s.</p>

<p>This is when the theoretical basis of flight finally got started. Physicists had the time to come up with theories that explained experimental results and made airfoils better in small and important ways. These ideas culminated in the 1933 NACA Report 460 which set the industry standard for the next several decades. Some of the airfoils in that report, like the NACA 2412, are still in use today. Many World War II planes used those designs too. Good examples include the DC-3 transport plane and the B-17 Flying Fortress.</p>

<p>The process of minor improvements based on theory continued into the 1940’s when NACA researchers invented the laminar flow airfoil and installed it on the P-51 Mustang. Unlike previous work, physicists took into account the effects of high-speed laminar airflow. In practice, this correction term is rather small and it led to modest improvements. It did, however, represent a philosophical shift in the way wings were designed, with greater emphasis placed on the physics of airflow. This focus on the causal mechanisms of flight ended up being crucial to later innovations in the supersonic regime.</p>

<p>In fact, there is a deep connection between how well we understand nature and what we are able to build. You can think about the laws of nature as “the rules of the game”. We are constantly learning more about these rules and it turns out that we can only innovate in proportion to how well we understand them. Consider evolution. Through millennia it has continually deformed life so as to probe the laws of nature at many different scales. So with time, the fundamental forces of nature have constrained and shaped life into the variety of forms we see today. Human design mimics this trial-and-error approach. But our mental models of the world give us an advantage. They amortize our search in proportion to how much of the physical world they can explain. And by acting on our mental models we can make intuitive leaps that evolution, in all of its billions of years, never could have managed. One such intuitive leap was made by Richard Whitcomb when he discovered supercritical airfoils.</p>

<p>Whitcomb made the discovery in 1965, a time when the aerospace industry was very interested in supersonic flight. Jet engines were invented at the end of World War II and provided sufficient means of propulsion for reaching supersonic speeds. But the larger challenge was that the physics of airflow changed at these speeds. Starting in the 1950’s, researchers at NASA and elsewhere had begun rethinking every aspect of airplane design to suit these new conditions. One of the most challenging problems was what to do about airfoil shapes.</p>

<p>Whereas his colleagues looked for solutions in aerodynamic theory, Whitcomb grabbed a can of putty and headed for the wind tunnel. He knew that the problem with existing airfoils was that air flowed at a higher rate around the top of the wing than the bottom. As the plane approached supersonic speeds, the air on top was the first to hit the sound barrier. Energy that was normally dissipated as sound would travel at the same speed as the plane and slowly accumulate. A shock wave would form. Then that shock wave would create all sorts of pathological drag and instabilities.</p>

<p>With this in mind, Whitcomb used putty to decrease the curvature of the wing so as to lower the airspeed above it. Then he added a slight concavity to the underside of the wing to maintain lift and stability. All of this was based on his intuitions for how air flowed over a wing, but it ended up being extraordinarily effective. In fact, the ‘supercritical’ wing design proved to be stable and efficient even at subsonic speeds. Today, virtually all modern airliners use supercritical airfoils.</p>

<p>It appears that the boundary between the imagination of the human mind and the constraints of the real world is where invention happens. If ideas are fully constrained to our minds, we have a tendency to indulge in impractical fantasies. Unaware of the hidden challenges of flight, such as airfoils, it’s easy to get distracted by extraneous details. And yet we need imagination too. For without imagination, we are reduced to the plodding trial-and-error pace of evolution. Imagination is our one clear advantage over evolution, for it requires no intermediary. For evolution to invent a wing, there needed to be a half-winged precursor. But imagination has a strangely liberating effect in that it allows us to move from one design to the next in a single intuitive leap.</p>

<p>The thing to remember is that intuition is never free. You need to build it over years of thought and care. Like physics, it helps you make sense of how the world works, but unlike physics, it is not reproducible. The job of the physicist is to distill these intuitions into more general laws. This has been a crucial part of aviation design over the past hundred years, for it has allowed engineers to design wings more and more from first principles. In fact, today it is possible to derive an entire airplane wing from scratch. I’m going to do just that in the next section, using nothing but the physics of flight.</p>

<h2 id="the-physics-of-flight">The Physics of Flight</h2>

<p>Legos are this wonderful meta-toy in that they represent the potential for a near-infinite number of toys depending on how you assemble them. Each brick has structure. But each brick is only interesting to the extent that it can combine with other bricks to form new and more complex structures. So in order to enjoy Legos, you have to figure out how they fit together and come up with a clever way of making the particular toy you have in mind. The open-ended design of Lego bricks lets you build nearly anything you want, and this ends up being incredibly satisfying.</p>

<p>As an adult, I find myself appreciating the same things in the physical world that I appreciated in Legos when I was younger. The beauty of the physical world is its simplicity. It’s a special kind of simplicity that, like Lego bricks, allows intricate structures to form at many levels. You see this everywhere you look in nature, across all scales of space and time. In the fractal design of a seashell or the intricate polities of a coral. In the convection of a teacup or the circulation of the atmosphere. And it’s this simple structure that determines the shape and behavior of even the most complicated flying machines.</p>

<p>To see this more clearly, we are going to start from the basic physical laws of airflow and use them to derive the shape of a wing. Since we’re using so few assumptions, the wing shape we come up with will be as fundamental as the physics of the air that swirls around it. This is pretty fundamental. In fact, if an alien species started building flying machines on another planet, my guess is that they would converge on a similar basic shape.</p>

<p>We will begin this journey with the “Navier-Stokes equation” which sums up pretty much everything we know about fluid dynamics. It describes how tiny fluid parcels interact with their neighbors.</p>

\[\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} = \underbrace{- (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection*}} + \underbrace{\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\text{viscous diffusion}} + \underbrace{f}_{\text{velocity $\uparrow$ due to forces}} \\
_\textit{*Self-advection refers to the fact that velocity gets moved in the direction of itself.}\]

<p>The process of solving problems in fluid dynamics generally comes down to writing out this equation and then deciding which terms we can safely ignore. In our case, we’d like to simulate the flow of air through a wind tunnel so that we can evaluate various wing shapes. Since the pressure differences across a wind tunnel are small, one of the first assumptions we can make is that the air is incompressible.</p>

<p>Another term we can ignore is viscous diffusion. Oil and molasses are examples of fluids with high viscosity. Air, on the other hand, has relatively low viscosity. Viscous interactions do form a boundary layer along the edge of an airfoil, but for the time being, the boundary layer is something we can ignore. The final term we can ignore is the forces term, as there will be no forces on the air once it enters the tunnel. And so we are left with but a hair of the original Navier-Stokes hairball:</p>

\[\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} = \underbrace{- (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{velocity follows itself (self-advection)}}\]

<p>This simple expression is responsible for the effects that really dominate wind tunnel physics. It says that the change in velocity over time is due to the fact that “velocity follows itself.” So the entire simulation comes down to two simple rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rule 1: Velocity follows itself</li>
  <li>Rule 2: Volume is conserved (because of our “incompressibility” assumption)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we’ve simplified wind tunnel physics as much as possible, let’s talk about how to add a wing shape. The wing is an internal boundary, or “occlusion” of the flow. A good way to represent an occlusion is with a mask of zeros and ones (Figure X). But since the goal of our wind tunnel is to try out different wing shapes, we need our wing to be continuously deformable. So let’s allow our mask to take on continuous values between zero and one. Now our wing is semi-permeable in proportion to its mask values.</p>

<p>We have succeeded in simulating a wind tunnel in just about 100 lines of code. Now it’s time to act upon it in order to create a wing. There are actually many qualities that one could look for in a good wing, but let’s begin with the most straightforward: we want a wing that gives high lift and low drag. In other words, we want it to convert horizontal air velocity into upward force. We can measure the upward force by the change in downward airflow, which is equal and opposite to the amount of lift.</p>

\[L/D = \frac{\text{lift}}{\text{drag}} = \frac{-\text{change in downward airflow}}{\text{change in rightward airflow}} = \frac{-\big ( v_y(t)+v_y(0) \big )}{v_x(t)-v_x(0)}\]

<p>At this point, we have both physical constraints and an objective. In the big picture, our goal is to change the wing mask so as to increase its overall lift/drag ratio as much as possible. The way to do this is to follow the gradient of the objective with respect to the wing shape. Luckily for us, there is a clever tool called Autograd which can compute that gradient analytically. Once we have the gradient, all we have to do is take incremental steps in that direction until we don’t see additional improvements. When this process of “gradient ascent” is over, we can hope to see a wing.
<button id="detailsButton3" onclick="toggleDetails3()" class="playbutton">Details</button></p>
<div id="details3" style="display:none">
	<p>
		Amazingly, every mathematical operation we've described so far, from the wing mask to the advection/projection steps to the calculation of the lift/drag ratio, is differentiable. This is why we can use Autograd to compute the analytic gradient. Autograd performs automatic differentiation, closely related to the adjoint method, to propagate gradient information backwards through the simulation until it reaches the parameters of the wing mask. We can do all of this in a one-line function transformation: grad_fn = autograd.value_and_grad(get_lift_drag_ratio).
