<p>In this project, we treat every pixel in an image as a biological cell. Then we train these cells to send signals to their neighbors so that, over time, the entire population will agree on what MNIST digit they are shaping. Every cell ‚Äúvotes‚Äù on the global shape by turning one of ten different colors, corresponding to the ten digits 0-9. Sometimes the truth prevails and sometimes they are collectively misguided. Sometimes conflicting signals cause different regions to be classified differently. I like <a href="https://twitter.com/hardmaru/status/1299152583328559105">@hardmaru‚Äôs example</a> of a 4 (üî¥) vs a 2 (üîµ). It‚Äôs similar to an election process. Even has ‚Äúswing states:‚Äù</p>

<p>Having given that quick summary, I encourage you to try the interactive demo and read the full article on Distill (link above). The SelfOrg group at Google Brain did a fantastic job and I enjoyed working with them on it.<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> This was the second article I helped write for Distill and I learned just as much as I did the first time. As an additional exciting update, I am now an Associate Editor for Distill, which means I get to spend some of my time working to improve the paper‚Äôs review and editorial process.</p>

<h2 id="useful-properties-of-cellular-automata">Useful properties of Cellular Automata</h2>

<p>One of the great parts of this article was rediscovering the magic of cellular automata (CAs). They are a niche topic in science, but they unite the <em>best parts</em> of biology, physics, and computer science. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Local.</strong> This is interesting because all interactions in physics are local ‚Äì aside from entanglement, and I have my suspicions on that.<sup id="fnref:fn2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> All interactions in chemistry and biology are also local, including the interactions between neurons that allow us to learn. The value of locality is that it is one of the <em>strongest</em> upper bounds on the complexity of a system. Without locality, any unit (atom, molecule, cell, human) can interact with any other and</li>
</ul>

<p>Strong biological (and physics) analogy. No combinatorial wiring problems (like with neural nets)</p>
<ul>
  <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Parallelizable.</strong> Train on 50x50, run on 500x500</li>
  <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Scalable.</strong> Good for GPUs. Also good for networks of GPUs</li>
  <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Expressive.</strong> Turing complete, universal, etc.</li>
  <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Emergence.</strong> Interesting and unexpected behaviors</li>
</ul>

<p>One day, we may use them to build self-organizing systems in the real world. Maybe we can use them to construct modular robots that deform themselves into different shapes? Or a language for programming living tissues? Or really fast and accurate simulation of physics?</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>We have unleashed self-classifying digits upon the world. Now, on thousands of different browsers, wherever they may be, our little cells are coming to life. They are looking at their particular MNIST pixels, talking to their neighbors, and trying to figure out what their overall digit shape is. Little do they know, they are part of a human scientific endeavor that is much the same. For we humans, too, are looking at our local surroundings, talking with our neighbors, and trying to agree on the overall shape of our reality.</p>

<p>Best of luck to the little cells and to us humans as well.</p>

      <p>My main contribution, by the way, was to help write the article. Alex, Eyvind, and Ettore obtained the core results.
