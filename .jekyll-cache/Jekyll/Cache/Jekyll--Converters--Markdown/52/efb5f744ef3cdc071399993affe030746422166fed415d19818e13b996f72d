<p>When I was growing up, hummingbirds used to fly into our garage and get stuck. I remember finding one perched on a windowsill, weak from exertion. It let me fold my hands around it and carry it outside. And when I opened my hands, it lay on my palms for a moment. That’s when the sunlight ignited its iridescent plumage and engulfed its whole body in a cloud of blues and greens. Then it understood it was free, whirred its wings, and vanished into the open air. Long after it had departed, my mind’s eye gazed upon the little bird. With an idle curiosity, I tried to imagine how natural forces could have wrought such a thing. We know of lift and drag, thrust and gravity as rough textbook concepts. But it’s another thing entirely to gaze upon a creature of beauty and sophistication and realize that it was shaped in part by those simple forces.</p>

<p>Since my encounter with the hummingbird, I have always been naturally drawn to flight. It’s a bizarre desire to possess, since humans did not evolve to fly. And yet many humans have felt the same way over the years. Entire cultures, even, have dreamed of flight. And step by step, they have used technology to fashion their own artificial wings and bring about the modern-day miracle of flight. The purpose of this essay is to recount that epic adventure. I will tell it through the lens of history, looking at the individual people who wanted to fly, the lens of technology, looking at the key inventions leading up to modern airplanes, and the lens of physics, looking at the equations of airflow that made it all possible. As a final flourish, I will derive a wing from scratch by simulating a wind tunnel, differentiating through it, and using gradient descent to deform a rectangular occlusion into a wing.</p>

<h3 id="the-early-aviators">The Early Aviators</h3>

<p>In the past century alone, airplane design has progressed from the Wright brothers’ ramshackle <em>Flyer</em> to Lockheed Martin’s streamlined <em>SR-71 Blackbird</em>. In parallel, our commercial aviation system has developed to the point where anyone can enjoy the possibilities of flight. Flight has become so common and so reasonable that it’s easy to forget the towering lusts and follies that accompanied its invention. But if we are to understand why humans wanted to fly in the first place, we need to relive those lusts and follies. One way to do this is by looking back at the lives of the early aviators.</p>

<p>Perhaps none of the early aviators wanted to fly as much as the tower jumpers. Beginning in the Middle Ages, there was a string of inventors who fashioned wings for themselves and then leaped from towers in imitation of birds. These daredevils were the tower jumpers. Having neglected the essential calculations of lift and drag, they relied mostly on wits, intuition, and dumb luck to survive. Alas, gravity tended to be stronger. Most of their attempts ended in death or serious injury. But one exception to the rule was the Andalusian inventor Abbas ibn Firnas. The story goes that he made his jump at the astonishing age of seventy years. Once he was airborne, his feather suit cushioned his fall and allowed him to glide to the ground unharmed.<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Somehow, in spite of his wild deeds, Abbas lived on to the respectable age of 78.</p>

<h3 id="the-freedom-of-flight">The Freedom of Flight</h3>

<p>The common folk of Andalusia must have enjoyed laughter and endless conversations about Abbas and his wingsuit. They would have asked, why does he want to fly? Pigs do not have wings and they are quite content about it. Why should humans, who likewise have no wings, want to pretend at flight? They would have been making a good point. After all, the tower jumpers needed to be more than half mad to take the risks they did. But on a fundamental level, they were probably driven by things that most humans can relate to: the desires for freedom, glory, and adventure.</p>

<p>We can see this in Leonardo da Vinci, whose work on flight was deeply rooted in a desire for freedom. Most people know that da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa and sketched a number of remarkable flying machines. However, few of them are aware of the pressures that shaped him.<sup id="fnref:fn2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Leonardo began life as the illegitimate son of an Italian aristocrat and a peasant woman. And so he had to support himself from an early age by taking on strict apprenticeships and painting for wealthy patrons. The fact that he was gay complicated things even further. His life reached a moment of crisis on his 27th birthday when he and his friends were imprisoned for acts of sodomy. Imprisonment affected him deeply. As soon as he was released, he sketched a machine meant to “open a prison from the inside” and another for tearing bars off of windows. Around the same time, he became obsessed with bird flight and began buying birds at markets in order to sketch them. When he finished sketching them, he would free them from their cages. “Once you have tasted flight,” he wrote, “you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward. For there you have been, and there you will always long to return.”” For da Vinci, flight seems to have been a metaphor for freedom and an antidote to the horrors of captivity.</p>

<h3 id="the-glory-of-flight">The Glory of Flight</h3>

<p>But freedom is not the only reason people wanted to fly. For others, flight was a shot at glory – and nobody loved glory more than the French chemist Pilatre de Rozier. This man was quite a character. He was known to breathe fire, seduce older women, and give himself fake titles.<sup id="fnref:fn3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> As a young scientist, he signed his papers, “Apothecary,” then “first Apothecary,”” and finally, “Pharmacy Inspector” of the Prince of Limbourg. This impressed his colleagues until they discovered that the Prince of Limbourg did not, in fact, exist. But in a twist of irony, the same hunger for glory that hurt his reputation also led de Rozier to his greatest scientific breakthroughs. The first was the match, which he invented in order to show off his fire breathing skills in a public lecture. The second was the gas mask, which he used in a stunt that involved lowering himself into the fumes of a vat of fermenting beer. The final, and most significant breakthrough, was his completion of the first manned voyage in a hot air balloon. King Louis XVI wanted to put criminals in the balloon but de Rozier objected, saying “The glory should not be given to criminals!”<sup id="fnref:fn4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Pilatre was far from perfect, but his bravery and showmanship inspired people and gave aeronauts an immensely positive image in France. His initial balloon launch attracted a crowd of over a hundred thousand people. When these people saw him land safely, common attitudes about flight changed. No longer was human flight seen as a thing of folly. It became a source of national pride and a crowning achievement of science. And for many, it began to represent an exciting new frontier.</p>

<p>But not all early aviators were after freedom. For others the abstraction was glory – and none of them loved glory more than Pilatre de Rozier.</p>

<p>This man was quite a character. He liked to breathe fire, seduce older women, and give himself fake titles.<sup id="fnref:fn3:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> As a young scientist, he signed his papers, “Apothecary,” then “first Apothecary,” and finally, “Pharmacy Inspector” of the Prince of Limbourg. This earned him the respect of his colleagues…until they discovered that the Prince of Limbourg did not, in fact, exist. Ironically, it was this same hunger for glory that led de Rozier to his greatest discoveries. The first was the match. He invented it while showing off his mastery of fire to the public. The second was the gas mask, which he invented after lowering himself into the fumes of a vat of fermenting beer. And third, of course, was the manned voyage of a hot air balloon. King Louis XVI wanted to put criminals in the balloon but de Rozier objected, saying “The glory should not be given to criminals!”<sup id="fnref:fn4:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In spite of all his posturing, de Rozier really did give aeronauts a reputation for bravery and adventure. And in preventing the king from using criminals in the balloon, he built on da Vinci’s vision of the skies as a place of freedom rather than exile. By most accounts, de Rozier was a mediocre scientist, but what he lacked in intelligence he made up for in energy and persistence. Indeed, these two qualities are at least as important as intelligence when it comes to flight. For even the brilliant mind of Einstein was once badly mistaken about such things.</p>

<p>Few people realize that Einstein invented an airplane wing.<sup id="fnref:fn5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> It had a strange hump in the center which proved to be a dreadful mistake. Test pilots complained that it handled “like a pregnant duck” and years later Einstein confessed, “That is what can happen to a man who thinks a lot but reads little…I have to admit that I have been ashamed of my folly of those days.” Einstein is a good example of someone who was clever enough to make progress in aeronautics but didn’t have a deep desire to fly. The more successful pioneers saw flight as part of their destiny. At some point, the person and the plane became indistinguishable. Pilots like Audrey de Saint-Exupéry claimed that the sky was the only place where they could think clearly.</p>

<h3 id="flight-and-human-nature">Flight and Human Nature</h3>

<p>Saint-Exupery was another fascinating character. He was a pilot, but also one of France’s best poets and novelists. He brought his writing notebook with him on solo flights and once circled a landing strip for an hour to finish reading a novel.<sup id="fnref:fn6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> He is best known for writing the story, “The Little Prince” in which two aeronauts contemplate life, love, and human nature.<sup id="fnref:fn7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> Flight is a key metaphor in the story, probably because Saint-Exupery understood life best from that perspective. But we must remember that humans did not evolve to fly. In fact, it’s shocking that Saint-Exupery used something as artificial as flight to examine human nature. Perhaps this paradox is what makes flight a good metaphor. It highlights our irrational urges for abstract things like freedom, glory, or wisdom. For the early aviators, the pursuit of flight was not profitable. More often, it led to bankruptcy, social isolation, and death or injury. Leading an ordinary life would have been a more rational choice.</p>

<p>Amelia Earhart was deeply aware of this tension. She once wrote, “…I cannot endure at all times even an attractive cage.” In other words, she preferred the dangers and uncertainties of flight to the comforts of civilized life. But her words mean even more in context, for she wrote them in her prenuptial letter to her fiancé George Putnam.<sup id="fnref:fn8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> Putnam agreed to an open marriage with Earhart, and this let her push the limits of flight at a time when it was very difficult to become a female pilot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I cannot endure at all times even an attractive cage.” – Amelia Earhart</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s easy to think of Earhart, da Vinci, and the others as exceptions to a rule. Perhaps the majority of humans would prefer to keep both feet planted firmly on the ground. Yet how many of us have felt a twinge of envy for a hawk soaring effortlessly on the thermals? Flight is more than a practicality for us. Is it because we associate flight with freedom? Or glory? Or are these desires a manifestation of some deeper desire? Whatever the case, the thing that inspired the early aviators continues to live within us. Our grand challenge is to act on this desire. It’s not easy to do this, but we can learn a lot by turning our attention to the inventors of early airplanes. These are the people who, through a combination of luck and discipline, built the stepping stones of flight.</p>
