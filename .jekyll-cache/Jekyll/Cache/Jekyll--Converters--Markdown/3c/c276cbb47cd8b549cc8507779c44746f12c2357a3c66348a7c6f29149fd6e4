<p>In our old house, hummingbirds used to fly into our garage and get stuck. I remember finding one perched on a windowsill, weak from exertion. It let me fold my hands around it and sat motionless while I carried it outside. And when I opened my hands, it lay on my palms for a moment. That‚Äôs when the sunlight ignited its iridescent plumage and engulfed its whole body in a cloud of blues and greens. Then it understood it was free, whirred its wings, and vanished into the open air.</p>

<p>Long after it had departed, my mind‚Äôs eye gazed upon the little bird. With an idle curiosity, I wondered at the delicate balance of natural forces that had wrought such a thing. We know of lift and drag, thrust and gravity as rough textbook concepts. But it‚Äôs another thing entirely to gaze upon a creature of beauty and sophistication and realize that it was shaped largely by those simple forces.</p>

<p>I admire wings; I have always admired them. Looking at a wing, you get the sense that there is more than meets the eye. Beneath its surface simplicity lies a bedrock of sophisticated natural engineering. Every thermal, gust of turbulence, or acrobatic maneuver has been prepared for in advance by eons of evolutionary forces. Such command of the air will forever be beyond me with my apish physique. And yet what the human body lacks in aerodynamics, the human mind makes up for with its desire to fly.</p>

<p>When you think about it, it is very strange that we have a desire to fly. Our primate ancestors should have learned to fear the skies, for they were home to predatory eagles. Our fear of heights makes a lot more sense. After all, our bodies are not good at recovering from falls and we are certainly not adapted for flight. Yet for some reason we want to fly. Why would nature give us a desire that our bodies cannot satisfy?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is what drives us to build and create. Consider the hermit crab, who lives according to a similar paradox. His form is incomplete without his shell, yet he does not grow it. He is born with an urge to acquire one. And when he finds one, he cleans it and fits himself to it and his body grows or shrinks to make the fit perfect. The hermit crab and his home become one creature, even though the shell was once part of his environment. It is the same with humans and wings. After all, if we can think ourselves into flight, then in a sense we are as much a flying species as the birds, insects, and bats.</p>

<p>There are several ways to make these ideas more concrete and I will explore each of them in this series of posts. The first is to examine the human pioneers of flight: who they were, what they thought, and why they flew. For by studying them, we can get a better idea of how the urge to fly relates to human nature. The second is to examine the trial and error engineering process that ultimately led to modern airplane wings. After all, being able to manifest our desire to fly in the physical world is at least as important as the desire itself. And finally, I will build you a wing. I will do this by writing down the physics of airflow, using that physics to simulate wind, and then directing that wind onto a rectangle of matter. Then I will coax the rectangle to deform itself so as to generate efficient lift‚Ä¶and you will see that it deforms itself into the cross-section of a wing.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs how I will make my case that we are a winged species. For indeed we are, so long as we have the desire to fly.</p>

<h3 id="the-early-aviators">The Early Aviators</h3>

<p>From the Greek story of Icarus to the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci, humans have always gazed into the depthless blue sky and wondered at its possibilities. One of the great gifts of the scientific revolution was the ability to finally manifest those dreams. The past century has taken us from the Wright brothers‚Äô ramshackle Flyer to the razor-edged precision of the SR-71 Blackbird. And our commercial aviation system makes it possible for anyone to realize the possibilities of flight. Indeed, flight has become so common and so reasonable that it‚Äôs easy to forget the towering lusts and follies that brought us here. To remember those sensations, we need to look back at the humans for which the desire to fly was strongest: the early aviators. And of all the early aviators, perhaps nobody risked more in the pursuit of flight than the tower jumpers.</p>

<p>Beginning in Medieval times, there was a string of talented inventors who, after years of careful thought and study, strapped bird feathers to their arms, climbed to the top of the nearest tower, and leaped into the air. As with modern daredevils on TV, things tended to end rather badly for these people. An exception to the rule was the Andalusian inventor Abbas ibn Firnas. It wasn‚Äôt until the ripe old age of seventy that he finally strapped eagle feathers to himself and leaped off a cliff. But as tower jumpers go, he was a major success: the feather suit cushioned his fall and helped him glide to the ground where he sustained a few minor injuries.</p>

<h3 id="the-freedom-of-flight">The Freedom of Flight</h3>

<p>It‚Äôs easy to laugh at the tower jumpers for their foolish and unsophisticated approach to flight. However, it‚Äôs also worth admiring them for their willingness to risk everything. These people wanted to fly more than anything else. What motivated them? This isn‚Äôt a behavior that we see in, say, monkeys or dogs. Perhaps it has something to do with our capacity for abstraction. It would work this way: imagine a human who feels trapped by their circumstances. Without abstract thought, this person would simply wish for the details of their situation to change. But with abstract thought, they would develop a deep hunger for freedom in the abstract sense. Now, if they view the abstract idea of flight as something that confers freedom, it is entirely rational for them to put their effort into the pursuit of flight, especially if all other doors are closed. Take the story of Leonardo da Vinci for example.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúOnce you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward. For there you have been, and there you will always long to return.‚Äù ‚Äî Leonardo da Vinci</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people know that Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa and invented a series of remarkable flying machines. But few are aware of the pressures that shaped him. He was born the illegitimate son of an Italian aristocrat and so, in spite of his genius, lived a life without much political or financial power. While he was learning to paint and invent, he had to support himself by seeking out wealthy patrons. And he was gay. One of the turning points in his life occurred around his 27th birthday, when he was imprisoned for acts of sodomy. As soon as he was released, he sketched a machine meant to ‚Äúopen a prison from the inside‚Äù and another for tearing bars off of windows. He fell in love with the idea of flight as a form of freedom, and began buying birds at markets in order to free them from their cages. And of course, he began sketching flying machines like the da Vinci glider. ‚ÄúOnce you have tasted flight‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúyou will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward. For there you have been, and there you will always long to return.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="the-glory-of-flight">The Glory of Flight</h3>

<p>But not all early aviators were after freedom. For others the abstraction was glory, and none of them loved glory more than Pilatre de Rozier.</p>

<p>This man was quite a character. He liked to breathe fire, seduce older women, and give himself fake titles. As a young scientist, he signed his papers, ‚ÄúApothecary,‚Äù then ‚Äúfirst Apothecary,‚Äù and finally, ‚ÄúPharmacy Inspector‚Äù of the Prince of Limbourg. This earned him the respect of his colleagues‚Ä¶until they discovered that the Prince of Limbourg did not, in fact, exist. Ironically, it was this same hunger for glory that led de Rozier to his greatest discoveries. The first was the match. He invented it while showing off his mastery of fire to the public. The second was the gas mask, which he invented after lowering himself into the fumes of a vat of fermenting beer. And third, of course, was the manned voyage of a hot air balloon. King Louis XVI wanted to put criminals in the balloon but de Rozier objected, saying ‚ÄúThe glory should not be given to criminals!‚Äù</p>

<p>In spite of all his posturing, de Rozier really did give aeronauts a reputation for bravery and adventure. And in preventing the king from using criminals in the balloon, he built on da Vinci‚Äôs vision of the skies as a place of freedom rather than exile. By most accounts, de Rozier was a mediocre scientist, but what he lacked in intelligence he made up for in energy and persistence. Indeed, these two qualities are at least as important as intelligence when it comes to flight. For even the brilliant mind of Einstein was once badly mistaken about such things.</p>

<p>Few people realize that Einstein invented an airplane wing. It had a strange hump in the center which proved to be a dreadful mistake. Test pilots complained that it handled ‚Äúlike a pregnant duck‚Äù and years later Einstein confessed, ‚ÄúThat is what can happen to a man who thinks a lot but reads little‚Ä¶I have to admit that I have been ashamed of my folly of those days.‚Äù Einstein is a good example of someone who was clever enough to make progress in aeronautics but didn‚Äôt have a deep desire to fly. The more successful pioneers saw flight as part of their destiny. At some point, the person and the plane became indistinguishable. Pilots like Audrey de Saint-Exup√©ry claimed that the sky was the only place where they could think clearly.</p>

<h3 id="flight-and-human-nature">Flight and Human Nature</h3>

<p>Saint-Exupery was another fascinating character. He was a pilot, but also one of France‚Äôs best poets and novelists. He brought his writing notebook with him on solo flights and once circled a landing strip for an hour to finish reading a novel. He is best known for writing the story, ‚ÄúThe Little Prince‚Äù in which two aeronauts contemplate life, love, and human nature. Flight is a key metaphor in the story, probably because Saint-Exupery understood life best from that perspective. But we must remember that humans did not evolve to fly. In fact, it‚Äôs shocking that Saint-Exupery could write insightful stories about humans through the lens of something as artificial as flight. Perhaps that paradox is what makes flight a good metaphor. It highlights our irrational urges for abstract things like freedom, glory, or wisdom. For the early aviators, the pursuit of flight was not profitable. More often, it led to bankruptcy, social isolation, and death or injury. Leading an ordinary life would have been the more rational choice.</p>

<p>Amelia Earhart was deeply aware of this tension. She once wrote, ‚Äú‚Ä¶I cannot endure at all times even an attractive cage.‚Äù In other words, she preferred the dangers and uncertainties of flight to the comforts of civilized life. But her words mean even more in context, for she wrote them in her prenuptial letter to her fianc√© George Putnam. Putnam agreed to an open marriage with Earhart, and this let her push the limits of flight at a time when it was very difficult to become a female pilot.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs easy to think of Earhart, da Vinci, and the others as exceptions to a rule. Perhaps the majority of humans would prefer to keep both feet planted firmly on the ground. Yet how many of us have felt a twinge of envy for a hawk soaring effortlessly on the thermals? Flight is more than a practicality for us. Is it because we associate flight with freedom? Or glory? Or are these desires a manifestation of some deeper desire? Whatever the case, the thing that inspired the early aviators continues to live within us. Our grand challenge is to act on this desire. It‚Äôs not easy to do this, but we can learn a lot by turning our attention to the inventors of early airplanes. These are the people who, through a combination of luck and discipline, built the stepping stones of flight.</p>
