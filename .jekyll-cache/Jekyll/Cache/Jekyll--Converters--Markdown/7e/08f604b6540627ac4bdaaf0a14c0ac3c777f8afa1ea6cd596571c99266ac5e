I"¥[<p>By the year 1900, humans seemed to have figured out all the important ideas of aviation. There were patents for dozens of self-powered aircraft including biplanes,<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> seaplanes,<sup id="fnref:fn2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and bombers.<sup id="fnref:fn3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> There were also designs for retractable landing gear,<sup id="fnref:fn4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> aileron wing controls,<sup id="fnref:fn5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> and curved airfoils.<sup id="fnref:fn6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> To many people, these designs indicated that the age of the airplane was at hand. Indeed, by this time there were already two commercial airline startups<sup id="fnref:fn7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> and one program for constructing bombers, fully funded by the French government.<sup id="fnref:fn3:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> But there was just one problem: nobody had managed to fly a real airplane yet. In fact, the Wright brothers were still several years from achieving that breakthrough. As for bombers, seaplanes, and airline companies‚Ä¶such things were still many decades away.</p>

<p>This bizarre gap between theory and practice makes me think we need to be more conservative with the word ‚Äúinvention.‚Äù When we think of an invention, we usually think of a detailed design of the sort you could patent. But in the case of the airplane, we know that people patented dozens of airplanes that never could have flown. Were those patents really inventions? Otto Lilienthal, the first glider pilot, would have disagreed. ‚ÄúTo design an aircraft is nothing‚Äù he wrote, ‚ÄúTo build one is something. But to fly is everything.‚Äù</p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps we should think of invention as having two phases: design and demonstration. An invention isn‚Äôt complete until you‚Äôve shown that it can perform the task for which it was built. In this section, we will step out of the human mind and into the constraints of the physical world. This is a rough place to be, for only a small fraction of human ideas manage to survive. But those that do can produce fantastic results. And just as the delicate wings of a hummingbird are wonderful because of the forces that shaped them, so too are the wings of modern aircraft because of the extreme conditions they are designed to endure.</p>

<p>Since flight is a very complicated subject, I am going to focus specifically on the development of the modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfoil">airfoil</a>. There are no moving parts to an airfoil. In fact, the airfoil is just a two-dimensional shape that influences the speed of air above and below a wing. Prior to the Wright brothers, few people gave serious thought to airfoil design. But it just so happened that the details of this shape were of critical importance to the practical manifestation of flight, and this has continued to be the case to the present day. Only through repeated iteration of design and demonstration did we become aware of the airfoil‚Äôs surprising complexity.</p>

<h3 id="the-first-airfoils">The First Airfoils</h3>

<p>Lilienthal, with his emphasis on pragmatic results, made the first major contribution to airfoil design. He performed a detailed investigation of stork wings. Then, with their curvature in mind, he built artificial replicas in his laboratory and tested their lift coefficients. It took years of careful preparation to do all of this, but in the end he was able to make a successful glider flight. And when he finally flew, he was able to repeat the demonstration over and over again.</p>

<p>But even Lilienthal got some things wrong. The Wright brothers, in their efforts to build upon his work, discovered an error in his calculations.<sup id="fnref:fn13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn13" class="footnote">8</a></sup> This specific detail was enough to make them rethink the entire wing design. After testing hundreds of airfoils in a miniature wind tunnel, they settled on a shape that was just slightly larger and more arched. This doesn‚Äôt sound like a very sexy way to spend two years of research, but it was a crucial milestone on the path to real flight. The Wright brothers were a rare breed of practical dreamers who set themselves an ambitious goal and then broke it down into manageable bits. Each little bit represented an unknown variable, and step by step they ventured into the unknown, made sense of it, and turned it into something of value.</p>

    <div style="text-align:left;">Years of careful experiments by the Wright brothers yielded a new wing shape with a slightly more forward camber. This seemingly small change was crucial to the the <i>Flyer's</i> success.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In a way, the long hours of tedious labor are the sacrifice that a person must make when they pursue the romantic-sounding ‚Äúdesire to fly.‚Äù We‚Äôve seen that flight attracts people who tend to be radical and temperamental dreamers. They are not reliable people. And yet each of them had to discipline and civilize themselves, becoming the most dull and reliable of the lot of us, before earning the right to become a hero. Once again, the human capacity for abstraction seems to be a crucial ingredient to this cycle. The boring years of experiments become so closely linked to the idea and reward of flight that they become one. The work becomes the reward. This is a strange abstraction, and it‚Äôs amazing that our minds are capable of thinking this way.</p>

<p>And one might think that even if an individual can function this way, a society probably cannot‚Ä¶</p>

<h3 id="the-national-labs">The National Labs</h3>

<p>Yet this is exactly what happened next. The major airfoil designs of the 1910‚Äôs and 1920‚Äôs came out of national labs set up by forward-thinking governments at the beginning of World War I. At the time, airplanes were slow, unreliable, and expensive. They were great for stunts and parades, but close to useless on the battlefield. The purpose of the national labs was to change this.</p>

<p>The first innovations came out of Britain‚Äôs <a href="https://phys.org/partners/national-physical-laboratory/">National Physical Laboratory</a>. Researchers at this lab had far more manpower and resources than the early inventors, so they were able to test airfoil designs more thoroughly. They found that thicker wings with more forward camber gave better lift and promptly built this into their fighters.</p>

<p>The more relevant concern, however, was stability. The planes of World War I suffered from thin airfoil stall, which happens when the airstreams above and below the wing collide behind it. This creates drag and sends the plane into a stall. German engineers discovered that a thicker airfoil could reduce this effect, leading to the G√∂ttingen 398 design. They used this design on the Fokker D7 triplane and it ended up being one of the most dangerous fighters of the war.<sup id="fnref:fn8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn8" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>The most amazing thing about flight research during World War I was the speed that inventors could turn a good idea into real technology. It only took a year or two. The condensed timeline and extreme real-world impact served as a conclusive demonstration of the airplane‚Äôs value and finalized its transition from the world of ideas to the world of things. And the wonderful thing about realizing the potential of an invention is its tendency to become the bedrock for an entirely new generation of ideas.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs the story of the 1920‚Äôs and 1930‚Äôs, which is when the mathematical theory of flight got started. Physicists finally had the time to come up with theories that explained experimental results. They used these theories to make airfoils better in small but important ways. These ideas culminated in the 1933 NACA Report 460 which set the industry standard for the next several decades. Some of the airfoils in that report, like the NACA 2412, are still in use today. Many World War II planes used those designs too. Good examples include the DC-3 transport plane and the B-17 Flying Fortress.<sup id="fnref:fn9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn9" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The process of minor improvements based on theory continued into the 1940‚Äôs, when NACA researchers invented the laminar flow airfoil and installed it on the P-51 Mustang. This airfoil was important because it was one of the first innovations based on theory rather than experiment.<sup id="fnref:fn9:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn9" class="footnote">10</a></sup> In practice, the laminar flow correction was rather small and it led to modest improvements. It did, however, represent a philosophical shift in the way wings were designed, with greater emphasis being placed on physics than human intuition. This focus on the causal mechanisms of flight ended up being crucial to later innovations in the supersonic regime, since supersonic airflow is less intuitive to humans.</p>

<p>In fact, there is a deep connection between how well we understand nature and what we are able to build. You can think about the laws of nature as ‚Äúthe rules of the game‚Äù. We are constantly learning more about these rules and it turns out that we can only innovate in proportion to how well we understand them. Consider evolution. Through millennia it has continually deformed life so as to probe the laws of nature at many different scales. So with time, the fundamental forces of nature have constrained and shaped life into the variety of forms we see today. Human design mimics this trial-and-error approach. But our mental models of the world give us an advantage. They amortize our search in proportion to how much of the physical world they can explain. And by acting on our mental models we can make intuitive leaps that evolution, in all of its billions of years, never could have managed. One such intuitive leap was made by Richard Whitcomb when he discovered supercritical airfoils.</p>

<h3 id="supercritical-airfoils">Supercritical Airfoils</h3>

<p>Whitcomb made the discovery in 1965, a time when the aerospace industry was very interested in supersonic flight. Jet engines were invented at the end of World War II and provided sufficient means of propulsion for reaching supersonic speeds. But the larger challenge was that the physics of airflow changed at these speeds. Starting in the 1950‚Äôs, researchers at NASA and elsewhere had begun rethinking every aspect of airplane design to suit these new conditions. One of the most challenging problems was what to do about airfoil shapes.<sup id="fnref:fn9:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn9" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p>Whereas his colleagues looked for solutions in aerodynamic theory, Whitcomb grabbed a can of putty and headed for the wind tunnel.<sup id="fnref:fn10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn10" class="footnote">11</a></sup> He knew that the problem with existing airfoils was that air flowed at a higher rate around the top of the wing than the bottom. As the plane approached supersonic speeds, the air on top was the first to hit the sound barrier. Energy that was normally dissipated as sound would travel at the same speed as the plane and slowly accumulate. A shock wave would form. Then that shock wave would create all sorts of pathological drag and instabilities.<sup id="fnref:fn11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn11" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

<div class="imgcap_noborder" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:99.9%">
  <div style="width:99%; min-width:350px; display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">
    <img src="/assets/stepping-stones/supercritical_wide.png" style="width:100%" />
  </div>
</div>

<p>With this in mind, Whitcomb used putty to decrease the curvature of the wing so as to lower the airspeed above it. Then he added a slight concavity to the underside of the wing to maintain lift and stability. All of this was based on his intuitions for how air flowed over a wing, but it ended up being extraordinarily effective. In fact, the supercritical wing design proved to be stable and efficient even at subsonic speeds. Commercial airliners, which cruise at speeds around Mach 0.85, have almost universally adopted supercritical airfoils as a means of increasing fuel efficiency.</p>

<p>It appears that the boundary between the imagination of the human mind and the constraints of the real world is where invention happens. If ideas are fully constrained to our minds, we have a tendency to indulge in impractical fantasies. Unaware of the hidden challenges of flight, such as airfoils, it‚Äôs easy to get distracted by extraneous details. And yet we need imagination too. For without imagination, we are reduced to the plodding trial-and-error pace of evolution. Imagination is our one clear advantage over evolution, for it requires no intermediary. For evolution to invent a wing, there needed to be a half-winged precursor. But imagination has a strangely liberating effect in that it allows us to move from the ground to the sky in a single intuitive leap.<sup id="fnref:fn12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn12" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

<p>If intuition and imagination are the first immigrants to a new land, then formal scientific work is like the nation that follows. In the past century, scientists have constructed such a nation around the idea of flight. This nation is built on physical principles like ‚Äúcomputational fluid dynamics‚Äù, ‚Äúaeronautical science‚Äù, and ‚Äúturbulent flow.‚Äù Such principles are quite complex, but the question they aim to answer is simple: <em>how does flight work?</em></p>

<p>Today, one can use these principles to derive an entire airplane wing more or less from scratch. In fact,  I‚Äôm going to do just that in the next section, using nothing but the physics of flight‚Ä¶</p>
